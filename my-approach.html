        	<p class="intro-paragraph margin-bottom">Counselling is about having a safe space where you’re not afraid of being judged, so that you can talk about whatever is worrying or distressing you.  Exploring your thoughts and feelings and the things you do to cope helps you to develop your self-awareness.  Growing your understanding of the causes of your concerns and the reasons for your actions can create the opportunity to make changes, so that if you choose to, you can confidently set goals and develop new behaviours to improve your satisfaction with life.<br><br>
     
    The approach I use is person-centred which is a non-judgmental way of working, where the counsellor creates the right conditions to help someone increase their self-awareness; to move towards – and reach – their fullest potential. I may also use techniques and tools from cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness to tailor an individual approach for you.  </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
    If you are reading this, you have already taken the first step.  You are clearly considering counselling as an option and are seeking to find someone who you can work with.  As the relationship between you and your counsellor is a key part of ensuring counselling is effective, it is important that you feel comfortable with your counsellor.  This is why I suggest having the chance for us to meet together before you commit to counselling.<br><br>
    I offer a free 30 minute introductory session so that we can discuss what it is you want to work on and what you hope to achieve through counselling. It will give you the opportunity to see if you feel comfortable working with me and you can ask as many questions as you like about counselling and how it works.<br><br>

     Please <a href="contact.html" class="link">contact me</a> via phone or email to arrange an appointment. </p>
